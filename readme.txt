Monty Hall simulator.

A python 3.x simulator for running the classic Monty Hall problem game.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem

This program runs two simulations for each requested permuation. One is a control where the host selects a random door (thus not adding information about the unselected doors) and the second is a simulation of the game as described on the wiki page.

You should find that in the control, no option is a consistently better outcome than the other, and in the non-control, switching yields a far superior option than not switching!
